# Contributing to KubeArmor

Welcome to KubeArmor, and thank you for showcasing your interest in contributing to the KubeArmor [community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community). We are excited to have you join us in improving Linux runtime security through Kubernetes. The KubeArmor community abides by the CNCF [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md). Here is an excerpt:

_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

Since, KubeArmor is part of the Kubernetes Community, we request you to also go through the following:

- [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md): Kubernetes projects require that you sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before we can accept your pull requests.
- [Kubernetes Contributor Guide](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/): Main contributor documentation.
- [Contributor Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/contributor-cheatsheet.md): Common resources for existing developers.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the project or open source contributions in general, we encourage you to start by familiarizing yourself with KubeArmor via our KubeArmor Overview [Wiki](https://docs.kubearmor.io/kubearmor/quick-links/kubearmor_overview).

We maintain a list of curated issues that are great entry points:
- [Good First Issues](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22): Ideal for Beginners or new comers.
- [Help Wanted Issues](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- [Backlog Issues](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abacklog): Issues that are planned or pending implementation. These are great for contributors looking for meaningful and scoped technical work.
